      ### Archive

      - [x] The current branches are archived using [main.sh archive_branches](https://codeberg.org/forgejo-contrib/soft-fork-tools).

      ### PRs

      Offer assistance to deal with cherry-picking after the rebase

      * ~~all already had a heads up last week or know how to deal with rebase already~~
      * https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/pulls/1371#issuecomment-1100806

      ```
      Heads up: Forgejo is being [rebased on Gitea](https://codeberg.org/forgejo/forgejo/issues?q=Gitea+Rebase) today (that's a weekly occurrence). It means you will need to cherry-pick your commits on top of the newer base branch for this PR and maybe resolve conflicts. You can do that on your own time, you do not need to do that today. It can be in a week or a month and you can keep working in the meantime.

      Ideally Gitea would be a package that can be upgraded as any other Go package. But it is not designed in this way and the weekly rebase is the equivalent of such an upgrade, only it is more work.

      If you need help doing that, feel free to reach out in the [development chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/#forgejo-development:matrix.org).
      ```

      ### Gitea main & stable

      - [x] push Gitea main, release/v1.19, release/v1.20 in forgejo

      #### development

      Commits moved from one feature branch to another. One branch cherry-picks them, the other skips them.
      For each branch `forgejo-{ci,development,privacy,i18n,branding,f3,moderation,dependency}` go over the
      commits it contains. If one of them does not belong and should be moved to another branch
      add it to the `forgejo-???` takes commits from `forgejo-???` section.

      * `forgejo-???` takes commits from `forgejo-???`

      Per-branch notes.

      * `forgejo-ci`
        * squash [CI] enable minio tests in [CI] Forgejo Actions based CI for PR & branches
